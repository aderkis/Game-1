# Game-1
// Goal of Game 1: To achieve as many points as possible.
//
// Point System: Run through yellow blocks while avoiding red blocks.
//               The red blocks will not move, but they number of red blocks
//               on the playing field increases as the game goes on.
//               Hitting a red block causes the player to gain 1 point.
//               Hitting a red block causes the player to lose 5 points.
//
// How Game 1 is played: A user controlled block, the player, travels through the playing field in order
//                       to run through the yellow blocks. A total of 50
//                       yellow blocks will be put on the field. There will
//                       only be one yellow block on the field at one time.
//                       Run through yellow blocks while avoiding red blocks.
//                       The red blocks will not move, but they number of red blocks
//                       on the playing field increases as the game goes on.
//                       Once n (yet to be decided) seconds passes, that block will disappear to
//                       have another block replace it at a random position
//                       until 50 blocks have been on the field. Thus, the
//                       maximum points one can achieve is 50.
